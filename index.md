---

Dojo Shield is an open-source project designed to teach secure coding practices through engaging, hands-on workshops. The initiative enables developers, security professionals, and other tech roles to tackle security challenges in real-world scenarios.

Key features of the project:
-	**Interactive Workshops**: Participants engage in resolving practical security challenges based on real-world scenarios, focusing on vulnerability remediation rather than exploitation.
-	**Community-Centric Approach**: Encourages community participation by providing open guides and templates, enabling local adaptation and replication.
-	**Multidisciplinary Inclusion**: While primarily aimed at developers, the project also includes challenges and workshops that benefit product managers, UX designers, and other tech professionals.
-	**Global Accessibility**: Resources are made available in English and Portuguese, with plans for expansion into additional languages as the community grows.

The goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment where participants enhance their secure coding skills, share knowledge, and improve communication between development and security teams.
