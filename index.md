Dojo Shield is an open-source initiative designed to teach secure development practices through collaborative, hands-on workshops. It targets developers, security professionals, and multidisciplinary teams, aiming to bridge the gap between secure coding and real-world application security.

Key features of the project:
•	Interactive Workshops: Participants engage in resolving practical security challenges based on real-world scenarios, focusing on vulnerability remediation rather than exploitation.
•	Community-Centric Approach: Encourages community participation by providing open guides and templates, enabling local adaptation and replication.
•	Multidisciplinary Inclusion: While primarily aimed at developers, the project also includes challenges and workshops that benefit product managers, UX designers, and other tech professionals.
•	Global Accessibility: Resources are made available in English and Portuguese, with plans for expansion into additional languages as the community grows.

The goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment where participants enhance their secure coding skills, share knowledge, and improve communication between development and security teams.

### Road Map
The Dojo Shield roadmap for 2025 includes the following key milestones:

Q1: Structuring and Preparation
•	Finalize facilitator and participant guides.
•	Publish the initial set security challenges on GitHub. This challenges are content from another projects that give us the ideia to realize the Dojo Shield and had worked well in another hands on.
•	Launch social media accounts (LinkedIn, Instagram, Bluesky, and Mastodon).
•	Begin development of the website, including features like challenge filters and a global map of workshops.
•	Organize and host a global online event in March to introduce the project to OWASP Chapters and the broader tech community.

Q2: Launch and Initial Events
•	Release the website with all planned features.
•	Conduct the first workshops with OWASP Chapters and local communities.
•	Collect feedback from participants and facilitators.
•	Begin documenting best practices and success stories from early adopters.

Q3: Expansion and Adjustments
•	Develop new challenges focused on emerging topics.
•	Introduce a pipeline for community contributions on GitHub, allowing users to submit new challenges.
•	Explore opportunities to engage product, UX, and QA teams with tailored workshop formats.

Q4: Consolidation and Future Planning
•	Publish an annual report with metrics, case studies, and participant feedback.
•	Organize a global end-of-year event to celebrate the project’s impact.
•	Plan the 2026 roadmap, focusing on further expansion and multilingual support.
